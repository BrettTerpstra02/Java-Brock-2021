# Trapdoor-Engine
A simple game engine which started in Java and is currently being ported to C++

## Why?
It's a fun project to learn about C++/Java/OpenGL/Game Engine Design.

## Java? Game Engine???!!!
Java is the language I learned first, largely due to Minecraft. Added to the fact that the people who I started the project only knew Java due to being
first year compsci students compounded the choice to use Java with native C++ bindings. The Java engine is now considered abandoned and will likely not be
updated unless there is a project stuck in Java.

## C++ Engine?
So the C++ engine is my first big C++ project. My only projects before it was for school and as a result the code isn't exactly clean, clear, or even 
good C++. The code can be compiled on GCC 12 or MSCV (tested on 2022 Visual Studio)
