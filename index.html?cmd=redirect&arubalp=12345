<h2>BrockEvents WI-FI Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <h3>User Expectations:</h3>

    <p>Brock University is not responsible for the security and privacy of online transactions, data transmitted or loss of 
    information over BrockEvents Wireless Network.</p>

    <p>Because BrockEvents network is not encrypted, users of BrockEvents are encouraged to take steps
    to keep their Wi-Fi sessions secure and practice safe Internet use.</p>

    <p>Users of BrockEvents are solely responsible for the safety and protection of their devices from viruses, spyware spam or 
    any malware.</p>

    <p>Brock University is not responsible and will have no liability for any content uploaded, shared, transmitted, or 
    downloaded by user or any third party, or for anything a 
    user may encounter or any data that may be lost or compromised while connected to BrockEvents WI-FI.</p>

    <p>Inappropriate use of the BrockEvents is not permitted. These Terms and Condition do not list all possible inappropriate 
    uses but lists guidelines that Brock University may use to make a determination whether a particular use is 
    inappropriate:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Users must respect the privacy and intellectual property rights of others.</li>
    <li>Users must not use the service to access or download any material that is illegal.</li>
    <li>Users must respect the integrity of our network and any other public or private computing and network systems.</li>

    user, host, or network.</li>
    <li>Users must not use the service that extends coverage of BrockEvents wireless network to areas
    other than Brock University approved coverage areas.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Service Expectations:</h3>

    <p>Even though Brock University IT staff will make every effort to keep BrockEvents available, service levels can't be 
    guaranteed.</p>

    <p>The connectivity speed depends on the time of day, the number of devices using the network and types of activity that 
    it is being used for.</p>

    <p>Brock University does not guarantee any level of network speed or performance.</p>

    <p>Technical support for BrockEvents is limited and will not be provided after-hours and on weekends or holidays.</p>
